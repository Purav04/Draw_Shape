-> This web app has three features yet,
   1) Clear the whiteboard
   2) Predict the words from whiteboard (take some time and it will show you "Prediction is :" like this on the top of the buttons)
   3) Draw the shape

Till now, prediction of the words are completed with the use of pytesseract and working on the AI model to draw the shape. 
right now, there is static code used to draw the shape not AI.

drawable shapes are: line,rectangle,square,circle,triangle,scalene,oval.

# Working:
1) trying to make prediction faster
2) making AI model for drawing 

# Future Plans:
1) AI to draw shape
2) Adding another feature "fill" to fill color inside the shape by AI model.
