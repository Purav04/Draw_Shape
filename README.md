-> This project has three features yet,
   1) Clear the whiteboard
   2) Predict the words from whiteboard
   3) Draw the shape

Till now, prediction of the words are completed with the help of pytesseract and working on the AI model to draw the shape. 
right now, it's static where there is code which is used to draw the shape not AI.

drawable shapes are: line,rectangle,square,circle,triangle,scalene,oval.

# working:
-> tring to make prediction faster
-> making AI model for drawing 

# future plans:
-> AI to draw shape
-> building another feature "fill" to fill color inside the shape.
